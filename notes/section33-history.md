# Section 33 - Extra: History of the Web

- What problems did we have in the past?
- How did we find solutions to these problems?
- Where does that leave us today?
- What does it mean to be a web developer?

## WWW vs Internet

[Maps that explain the internet](https://www.vox.com/a/internet-maps)

Sir Tim Berners Lee - invented World Wide Web in 1989

- ARPANET, created in the late 1960s, was the precursor to the modern internet
  - An academic research project funded by the Advanced Research Projects Agency
  - Still difficult for computers to communicate with each other and share academic papers due to different languages
  - Academics needed a way to share documents

The World Wide Web is an agreed upon common language and protocol

- Used for computers to speak to each other
  - To share files, images, etc. OVER The Internet
- Tim Berners Lee created first browser, server, and website
  - [First Website in 1993](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html)
  - He created this ability for people to communicate and link to other documents
    - Leads to growing knowledge base of the world

## HTML, CSS, JavaScript

HTML is a way for us to write text on websites

- Hyperlinks can link to other parts of a website
- This was initially a way to share documents in 1991

CSS and JavaScript came around in '95/'96

- CSS adds visual aspects and aesthetics
- JavaScript adds interaction

## Developer Fundamentals: II

We have multiple web browsers, first created as a standardized way to share web documents

- Files can be read using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Browser wars - each browser had their own implementations and way of doing things
  - This still exists to some degree today
  - Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge, etc.

To this day, a major pain point for developers is the need to have files appear the same across all web browsers.

- Mobile devices and tablets also means pages must be responsive to different screen sizes
- Pages will need to be tested on every browser and every device

## Developer History

- Early 2000s - web pages were built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and also JQuery
  - JQuery - library that allowed JavaScript to be written in a simple, clean way
  - Enabled JavaScript to work across all browsers
  - Backend - LAMP Stack
    - Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP
    - PHP enabled logic on Apache servers
    - MySQL (database)
- Current developers
  - Frontend - HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript + React
  - Backend - Node.js + Express.js (server), PostgreSQL + MongoDB (database)
  - Clean, fast, bug free applications
