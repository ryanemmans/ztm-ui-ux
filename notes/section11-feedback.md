# Section 11 - Feedback

## Receiving Feedback

- Design critiques are full of subtleties
  - Can quickly turn painful when you don't define a process or egos get in the way
- Proper context and design stages should be clarified prior to asking for feedback

### Why is feedback so important?

- Feedback helps you distance yourself from your design
  - When we become attached, we may make choices that don't necessarily benefit the users
- Reminds us that design is a craft
- Gives a new perspective on our designs to avoid tunnel vision
- Helps you grow as a designer
  - New insights and approaches
- Improves your ability to work with teams and clients

### How to get *good* feedback

2 types that have significant impact on design

1. Constructive - helps move design forward
    - Uncover clues to help answer open questions
    - Identify new blockers
    - Add momentum towards a direction
    - Can be both negative and positive
2. Destructive - clouds the way a design moves forward
    - Asking misleading or unrelated questions can derail discussions
    - Noise can make it difficult to understand what matters
    - Clients, design critiques, feedback meetings
      - Irrelevant ideas popping up that do not help solve problems or general designs

## Constructive feedback is the goal!

### Be clear and provide **context**.

- Without context, each person may have a different understanding of how far along a design is.
- Prepare invitees ahead of time with brief intro before meeting

### Identify clear goals

- Also state goals that may be out of scope or not yet relevant
- Identify and communicate the stage of the design process
  - Set expectations
  - Fidelity grows over time
    - Visual feedback can bog down discussion if you're not to that stage yet

### Ask the big open questions you want answers to

- Attendees can then provide value and insight

### Invite only the people you need to

- Unfortunately not all feedback is equal
- Constructive feedback needs to come from the right people
  - Those who understand the space, product, users
- Think about the problems your trying to solve
  - Who has the answers to your questions?

Who is Mandatory and who is Optional?

- Most knowledge of problem space
  - eg. Developers, internal stakeholders
- Optional attendees may bring surprising insights

### Mobilize the group

- Put attendees to work and get entire group involved
  - Step 1: Feedback generation
    - Use whiteboard with stickies - timebox 5 or so minutes - questions, discussion points.
  - Step 2: Vote - timebox, enough time to go over list
    - prioritize stickies - most impactful or relevant
  - Step 3: Discuss - most important stickies based on votes

### Stay On Track

- Address relevance of issues brought up
- Restate goal from beginning of meeting
- Bookmark irrelevant feedback and come back to it as a group at a later time
  - Attendees will also know they are not being ignored

## Recap:

- Context
- Set goals for meeting
- Gather the people who *should* be there
- Have the group work together
  - Provide feedback as a group to avoid one voice dominating the room
  - Right feedback from right people
- Stay on track
