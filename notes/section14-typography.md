## Serifs

Traditional, sometimes elegant

- Small curls at ends of letter forms
- Generally used in body copy
- Standard applications, but rules are flexible depending on need

### 4 categories/sub-types:

1. Old Style - humanist/oldest - mid 1400s
    - Goudy
2. Transitional - more pronounced strokes
    - Times New Roman, Baskerville
3. Modern - very highly constrasted strokes (thick to thin)
    - Didot, Bidoni
4. Slab - little to no contrast between lines, rectangular/boxy
    - Courier, Archer

## Sans Serifs

Sans - french for without

- Much more modern in appearance

### 4 categories/sub-types:

1. Grotesque - earliest, letterform contrasts weights similar to some serif typefaces
    - Source Sans Pro, Franklin Gothic
2. Neo-Grotesque - some of most common, plain and uniform, less contrast
    - Helvetica, Arial, Universe
3. Humanist - greater variation between line-widths
    - Gills Sans, Tahoma
4. Geometric - based on geometric shapes
    - Futura, Proxima Nova
## Display & Mono

### Display Typefaces

Broadest category, most variation
- Ex: Lobster, Abril
- Unsuitable for body copy, would be very hard to read
- Headlines, larger text
- Used to draw attention

### Monospace Typefaces

Fixed pitched/width, or non-proportional fonts
- Same amount of horizontal space
- Ex: Roboto Mono
- Best used for technical fonts
- Widely used for coding and programming to read individual characters
- Better and more legible for punctuation / alignment

## Picking Typefaces

### Emotion of type

Typeface mood and personality

- Formal, traditional
- Light, modern
- Comes down to typeface design

Some typefaces can convey almost any mood (Helvetica)

- Typefaces for specific purpose can help represent and reinforce the voice of a brand.
