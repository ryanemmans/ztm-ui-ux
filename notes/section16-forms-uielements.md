# Section 16 - Forms & UI Elements

## What are Forms & UI Elements?

Elements within a user interface

- Cards, icons, navigation, badges, pickers, etc.
- Forms are most common, probably most important
  - Forms are everywhere
  - Consist of inputs, buttons, etc.

***Forms are crucial to the success of the product you are designing for.***

### Where to Start

- PLAN, beginning with sitemap
- Know what type of content you are dealing with
  - Ex: search, registration
- Before even building a form - What questions do you want to ask the user?
  - Quick prototyping, testing, iteration
  - Generate ideas, revisit, and refine

## Best Practices for Forms

Forms should feel like a friendly conversation between the user and the product.

- When creating forms, they should be kept as short as possible
  - Only ask absolutely necessary questions
  - Asterisks muddy a design

- Conversations should have a logical flow
  - You would not typically ask for sensitive information first

![Forms 2](../img/forms2.png)

- Longer forms should be broken up into digestible groups

![Forms 3](../img/forms3.png)

- Because we read top to bottom, left to right, columns should remain consistent as to not be confusing

- Users also tend to think of right as the *next* step and left as going *back* or the *previous* step.
  - This depends on the context of the situation
- Use secondary buttons whenever possible to prevent users from making mistakes

- Sometimes long forms will need to be split into entirely different pages
  - Long forms will be treated differently on mobile vs desktop
