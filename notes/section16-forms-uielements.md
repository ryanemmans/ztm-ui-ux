# Section 16 - Forms & UI Elements

## What are Forms & UI Elements?

Elements within a user interface

- Cards, icons, navigation, badges, pickers, etc.
- Forms are most common, probably most important
  - Forms are everywhere
  - Consist of inputs, buttons, etc.

***Forms are crucial to the success of the product you are designing for.***

### Where to Start

- PLAN, beginning with sitemap
- Know what type of content you are dealing with
  - Ex: search, registration
- Before even building a form - What questions do you want to ask the user?
  - Quick prototyping, testing, iteration
  - Generate ideas, revisit, and refine

## Best Practices for Forms

Forms should feel like a friendly conversation between the user and the product.

- When creating forms, they should be kept as short as possible
  - Only ask absolutely necessary questions
  - Asterisks muddy a design

- Conversations should have a logical flow
  - You would not typically ask for sensitive information first

![Forms 2](../img/forms2.png)

- Longer forms should be broken up into digestible groups

![Forms 3](../img/forms3.png)

- Because we read top to bottom, left to right, columns should remain consistent as to not be confusing

![Forms 4](../img/forms4.png)

- Users also tend to think of right as the *next* step and left as going *back* or the *previous* step.
  - This depends on the context of the situation
- Use secondary buttons whenever possible to prevent users from making mistakes

- Sometimes long forms will need to be split into entirely different pages
  - Long forms will be treated differently on mobile vs desktop

## Best Practices for Inputs

Inputs are the most complex UI elements due to their versatility, different states, and frequent use

### Part 1

- Text Field - single line, most common
- Text Area - for longer responses (multiple lines)
- Dropdown Menus - select menus, best for 5 or more predefined options
- Check boxes - used for one or ***multiple*** selections, best for 4 or less options
- Radio buttons - multiple options, but can ONLY select ONE, again best for 4 or less options

#### Advanced Inputs

- Multi-select text field - add multiple inputs, displayed as chips
  - Users can typically add and remove chips

- Dropdown search - available matching options appear as user types

### Part 2

- Height of input should always be same height as primary button
  - Maintains visual consistency
- All input fields in a form should be the same length (as a guideline)
  - This depends on the information we are asking of the user
  - Example of an exception:

![Input Best Practices 1](../img/inputs-bp1.png)

- Nudge spacing should be based off of base unit (4px) - use `control` + `shift` + `arrow` to nudge
- **Labels** should be short and sweet!
  - Clear, easy to read, 1 to 2 words
  - Contrast from input font (bold, shrink, sometimes lower opacity) - hierarchy
  - Only first letter capitalized for easy scanning / readability

![Input Best Practices 2](../img/inputs-bp2.png)

- Placeholders can show repetitive information
  - Can also hide important information and reduce accessibility
  - Can be problematic if used as labels or hints
  - Harder to see due to lower contrast, often undetected by page readers
  - Hint text can be used on right side of label instead (date formats, number inputs, etc.)
