# Section 31 - From Figma to Website: Building Our Landing Page

## Initial Setup - Figma Handoff

Notes and shortcuts: [here](https://www.figma.com/best-practices/tips-on-developer-handoff/an-overview-of-figma-for-developers/).

- Designers and developers could define naming conventions for Styles early in the process
  - Building a unified shared design language across the team.

### Coding a website

- Final result must be as close as possible to original design
- A smart yet simple way to achieve perfect results:
  - Open two browser windows side by side - local site and Figma file.
  - Windows must have same width as frame you need to compare with the local site.
  - Quick and easy way to spot inconsistencies in spacing and sizes.
  - Helps train your design-eye s AKA the third developer’s eye.
