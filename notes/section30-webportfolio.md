## Content for Your Portfolio

  - They want to see that you can think through different types of problems and come up with great solutions.
- A web based portfolio is the best way to land a position.
  - Do not just show imagery
  - Talk about the specific work you contributed to a project
    - Problem, type of research, ***PROCESS***
