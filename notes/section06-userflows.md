# Section 6 - User Flows

## What is a user flow?

- A series of steps the user takes to achieve a meaningful goal.
- Used to communicate the intended flow of the user through various pages and actions.
- Should include name, steps, users, and a description of what happens at each step.

### What the user sees -> What they do -> (next screen) What they see next -> What the do next

1. What is the goal or purpose? (Title)
    - Who is doing it?
    - How do they do it?
2. User flows go in ONE direction, despite popular belief.  
3. Describe each of your steps
    - Represent a complete task
