# Section 29 - Where to Go From Here?

## Project Handoff

- Silo - traditional way in which designers work with developers
  - Designers would work by themselves, then just hand off for developer to create pixel perfect products
  - Not always the best due to lack of communication and exchange of ideas
  - Developer may have no idea what client wants
- Much more common now for designers to work more collaboratively with developers, product managers, scrum masters, etc.
- Post launch phase always calls for reiteration and improvement

The key to successful handoff is for the designer to always keep the developer in mind

- What can *technically* be done?
- Design effectively for the platform you're building in
- Have a mutual language

"Always design/code as if the person who ends up maintaining your work will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live."
